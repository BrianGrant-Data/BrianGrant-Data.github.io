# What and Why is Git?
Git is a version control system used by many programmers to save and store versions of their code. The more you code the more useful Git is since it not only saves versions of your code, but allows you do see what changed, when it changed and (when multiple people are working on a program) who changed it. Perhaps the most important feature of Git is it's ability to view, load and edit old versions. This makes testing code a lot easier to track. Github, a website that handles Git files makes navigating Git a lot easier, but it also stores the data on their servers for free so you don't have to!

Github holds each of your projects in something called a repository. You can have a copy of the repository on your local computer and link it to your Github repository.

Since you can set up, alter and update repositories through many different IDEs (including Rstudio or Visual Studio Code), I will show you how to use it via the terminal for now.
